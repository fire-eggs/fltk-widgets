FLTK Widgets which I've created.

- Last Used / Most Recently Used menu
- [Time Entry](#TimeEntry) : enter a length of time
- [KeyEdit](#KeyEdit) : enter a key chord/shortcut
- Show Dialog
- Transparent Widgets

## Widgets

### KeyEdit Widget

A widget for entering keyboard chords / shortcuts. Entering keystrokes in the widget are shown as shortcut text (as might be used in a menu).

A screenshot, with the widget initialized to the `CTRL+Left-Arrow chord`.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/fire-eggs/fltk-widgets/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.




### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

```

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/fire-eggs/fltk-widgets/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
